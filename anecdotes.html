      <h2>A Cathedral Shaped by Centuries</h2>
      <p>
        Leicester Cathedral has stood as a symbol of community and faith for many centuries.
        Its medieval tower and stonework have watched the city grow and change around it,
        while the building continues to welcome new generations of visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beneath the surface, however, the ground preserves much older traces of the people
        who lived, worked and worshipped on this site long before today’s Cathedral took shape.

      <h2>Opening Up the Cathedral Site</h2>
      <p>
        The excavations began with the careful removal of modern surfaces and rubble around the Cathedral.
        Archaeologists and contractors worked together to strip back the upper layers so that earlier deposits
        could be reached safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage the area can look like a building site, but every layer of soil has the potential to
        contain clues about Leicester’s past. Once the ground is opened up, archaeologists can decide where to
        dig more deeply and start to uncover the stories hidden beneath the surface.

    <div class="entry-text">
      <h2>What Lies Beneath: Excavations by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS)</h2>
      <p>
        As work went deeper, the excavations revealed walls, grave cuts and other structures that had been
        buried for centuries. Layers of burials, building foundations and later alterations show how the
        churchyard and Cathedral were rebuilt and reused over a long period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside these larger features, the soil also produced smaller finds such as pottery, animal bone
        and oyster shell. Together, these remains help archaeologists to reconstruct everyday life around
        the Cathedral and to explain how the site developed into the building visitors see today.

    <div class="entry-text">
      <h2>More Stories Beneath the Surface</h2>
      <p>
        Inside the Cathedral, stained glass windows show scenes of faith, local history and
        everyday human experience. Coloured light and patterned glass turn stories into images,
        just as the archaeology outside turns traces in the soil into stories about real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, the windows above and the layers below remind visitors that Leicester Cathedral
        is both a place of worship and a place of memory, where new generations can explore the past.

      <h2>Continuing the Cathedral’s Story</h2>
      <p>
        The reinterment of King Richard III in 2015 brought worldwide attention to Leicester Cathedral
        and to the city’s archaeological work. His tomb inside the Cathedral is now a major focus for
        visitors, linking national history with the local community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cathedral remains a living place, shaped by its long past and by the work of archaeologists,
        conservators and educators today. The stories uncovered in the ground now feed into family
        activities such as “Cathedral Kids: The Big Dig”, helping children discover the history
        beneath their feet.
